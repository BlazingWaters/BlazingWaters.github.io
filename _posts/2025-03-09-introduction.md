Since I've decided to migrate to a personal blogging site for... several reasons, I went into looking various tutorials on how to do just that. Please github fucking WORK WITH- Ok nvm it worked lol I'm impatient.

Although <a href="https://birthbydrip.neocities.org/">Pangburn</a> and, extremely recently at the time of writing, <a href="https://testamentenjoyment.net/">Durandal</a> are using the Hugo format, I settled on Jekyll cause... idk why not. Gives me more time to iron out my Markdown knowledge at least.

I'll do a proper post or review or somethin Soonâ„¢. This was just done to test if the site was working properly. And it is! So that's good. For now, I'll upload three recent(ish) stuff I've done from Backloggd.

> I will have access to four different Prompts that I will force myself to use, to help distinguish all information into specific blurbs.  
Info will be for any setup necessary, ESPECIALLY for PC startup and/or recommended patches/hacks for ROMs.
{: .prompt-info }

> Danger prompt will be for any content warnings or similarly extreme subject matter.
{: .prompt-danger }

> ## Warning's to highlight spoiler alerts, in case you want to avoid something you became intersted in.   
They will also be marked by Header Size 2 (or 3, getting a feel) to make them visible by both you, and the TOC.
{: .prompt-warning }

> Tip will have, well, various tips/tricks/special detail that I want to emphasize.
{: .prompt-tip }
