# What The Hell Is This?

Since I've decided to migrate to a personal blogging site for... several reasons, I went into looking various tutorials on how to do just that. Please github fucking WORK WITH- Ok nvm it worked lol I'm impatient.
Although <a href="https://birthbydrip.neocities.org/">Pangburn<a/> and, recently, <a href="https://testamentenjoyment.net/">Durandal</a> are using the Hugo format, I settled on Jekyll cause... idk why not. Gives me more time to iron out my Markdown knowledge at least.
I'll do a proper post or review or somethin Soonâ„¢. This was just done to test if the site was working properly. And it is! So that's good.
