Hey! I'm Jason (pronouns He / They), AKA BlazingWaters, itself a portmanteau moniker referencing hip-hop albums [*Blazing Arrow* by Blackalicious](https://youtu.be/hH21mkGhvFU?list=OLAK5uy_mdFgM_kU3yZv5ZtjismKFou6DSIhqqKxQ), and [*Muddy Waters* by Redman](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_lKrUdhwFsNdTajV9oFIkW-Mh_3uH2SxT4). You might have seen me from [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com/u/BlazingWaters/) where I steadily became more involved with analyitcal writeups, or maybe from Muskrat's Twitter where I was a bit of a curmudgeon brat. I've decided to keep one spot for any and all musings I do in the future, since I got tired of Backloggd's userbase and cause I want to keep my rambles on social media somewhere more concrete.  
I'm not exactly a "critical" (read: heavily involved) type of person, but I do try and think about the creative process of something whenever I can, even if it's for a short bit.

In an effort to better hone my craft, I'm also (finally) gonna start creating/sharing short stories, mainly about characters from various RPGs I've played or am currently playing. I have an ACTIVE imagination, so I'm deciding everyone should be subjected to my autism. You will not be safe. I also hope you will like it, or I WILL cry. 

Here are some of my interests, to get a better understanding as to what I'm gonna be mainly dissecting:
- RPGs
- Platformers
- Action Games
- Hip-Hop, of course
- Electronica
