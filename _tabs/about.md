Hey! I'm Jason, AKA BlazingWaters (a portmanteau of hip-hop albums *Blazing Arrow* by Blackalicious, and *Muddy Waters* by Redman). You might have seen me from [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com/u/BlazingWaters/) where I steadily became more involved with analyitcal writeups, or maybe from Muskrat's Twitter where I was a bit of a curmudgeon brat. I've decided to keep one spot for any and all musings I do in the future, since I got tired of Backloggd's userbase and cause I want to keep my rambles on social media somewhere more concrete.  
I'm not exactly a "critical" (read: heavily involved) type of person, but I do try and think about the creative process of something whenever I can, even if it's for a short bit.

If you're completely new around here, here are some of my interests:
- RPGs
- Platformers
- Action Games
- Hip-Hop, of course
- Electronica
